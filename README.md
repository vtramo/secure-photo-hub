# Secure Photo Hub

A REST API for securely storing and managing photos and albums, developed for the Secure System Designs course at the University of Naples Federico II.

Uses AWS S3 for secure storage, Vault for secrets management, and Keycloak to centralize access control policies, leveraging a mix of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), alongside OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

Main requirements: confidentiality, availability, integrity of data, accountability, and authenticity.

In development.
